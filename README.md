# 💫 About Me:
I am a Diploma student in Computer Engineering at Vidyalankar Polytechnic, with a strong foundation in programming and software development. I have hands-on experience with C, C++, Java, Python, DBMS, and Data Communication & Networking, along with web development using HTML and CSS, UI/UX design using Figma, and a working knowledge of Linux.<br><br>I am deeply passionate about game development and interactive storytelling. I have practical experience in creating pixel art characters, developing visual novels integrated with mini-games, and implementing inventory systems and basic RPG mechanics using Ren’Py and Pygame. Recently, I have started exploring Godot Engine, where I am learning game environment design, level creation, GDScript scripting, basic C# integration, and real-time 2D/3D game mechanics, strengthening my understanding of modern game development workflows.<br><br>Alongside programming, I enjoy creating animations, video editing, and digital drawing, which helps me enhance visual design, storytelling, and overall player experience in my projects. These creative skills allow me to combine technical logic with artistic expression when building games and interactive systems.<br><br>Through my projects, I have significantly improved my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of game mechanics, player interaction, and system design. I enjoy experimenting with gameplay ideas and turning concepts into playable experiences.<br><br>In addition, I actively explore emerging technologies such as Prompt Engineering, Generative AI, beginner-level Machine Learning, IoT, Ethical Hacking, Digital Marketing, and Microsoft 365 tools, helping me stay aligned with current industry trends. I also have a strong interest in content creation and editing, with emphasis on clear communication and visual presentation.<br><br>I have prepared complete project documentation, including detailed project reports and viva Q&A, demonstrating solid technical understanding along with effective presentation skills. I am highly motivated toward continuous learning, building practical projects, and exploring opportunities in software development, game development (especially Godot), and web technologies. I look forward to learning from industry professionals and contributing to impactful and innovative projects.
